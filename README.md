Predicting used vehicle prices using Machine Learning

Determining the correct price of a used car is challenging due to various factors. Using machine learning techniques,we aim to build a model that canaccurately predict the prices of used cars based on various factors.
This data set is downloaded from Kaggle website:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data

Craigslist is the world's largest collectionof used vehicles for sale, yet it's verydifficult to collect all of them in the sameplace.

This data is scraped every few months, itcontains most all relevant informationthat Craigslist provides on car salesincluding columns like price, condition,manufacturer,latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories.

# Anticipated Results from Our Prediction of Used Cars:
We are trying to understand what features have influence on price of a used Vehicles. The anticipated results are as follows:

● Accurate prediction of used car prices: By using machine learning algorithms and various factors, the model is expected to accurately predict the prices of used cars, which can benefit both buyers and sellers.

● Improved understanding of the factors affecting used car prices: The process of building the model can provide a deeper understanding of the factors that impact used car prices, such as make and model, age, mileage, condition, and location.

● Better decision making for buyers and sellers: By having accurate and reliable information on used car prices, both buyers and sellers can make informed decisions when buying or selling a vehicle.

# Real-World Applications and Implications of Used Car Dataset Results:

● Automated Vehicle Pricing: Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the fair market value of a vehicle based on its make, model, year, condition, and other factors. This can assist dealerships, auction houses, and private sellers in accurately and competitively pricing their vehicles.

● Inventory Management: Dealerships and automakers can use machine learning algorithms to forecast demand for various types of vehicles and adjust inventory levels
accordingly. This can help them reduce the costs of holding excess inventory an increase their overall profitability.

● Leasing and Financing: Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the residual value of a vehicle and assist in determining the terms of a lease or loan. This can reduce the risk of default and terms offered to customers.
